    prompt = f"""You are a component of a Magic: The Gathering playing AI.
Your task is to decide the best blocks for the defending player given a set of attackers, a set of candidate blockers, and the current game state.

The current game state is as follows:
{game_state}

The attackers are:
{attacker_string}

The blockers are:
{blocker_string}

Please analyze the combat situation and provide a detailed explanation of the best blocking strategy for the defending player.
The criteria for the best blocking strategy are as follows:
1. Avoid losing the game.
2. Maximize the difference in total creature value destroyed (attacker minus defender).
Value is defined as the sum of the power and toughness of the creatures plus 0.5 times the number of abilities they have.
Skip defender in this calculation (it's worth 0), and count double strike twice (it's worth 1 instead of 0.5).
3. Maximize the difference in number of creatures destroyed.
4. Maximize the total mana value of creatures lost.
5. Minimize life lost.
6. Minimize poison counters gained.
Each criterion should only be considered after the previous one resulted in a tie.

Please provide your analysis followed by **exactly two** markdown sections.
The first section must be called "Block Assignments". Each line in this section
should contain the name of the blocking creature, an arrow ("->"), and the name
of the attacker it blocks. If no blocks can be made, write ``None`` on a single
line below the heading. For example:
#Block Assignments
- Serra Angel -> Grizzly Bears
- Wall of Omens -> Llanowar Elves
Follow this format exactly with no additional commentary or formatting inside
the block assignments section.
Finally, add a markdown section called "Combat Outcome", which contains the life total of both players after combat, any creatures that were destroyed, and any poison counters gained.
Do so in a format like this:
#Combat Outcome
Player 1 Life: 20
Player 2 Life: 15
Player 1 Poison Counters: 0
Player 2 Poison Counters: 1
Player 2 Creatures Destroyed: None
Player 1 Creatures Destroyed: Grizzly Bears
